Some tests need "resources" which need to be cleaned up when finished. Sometimes, these resources might be needed to be accessed by many tests. Furthermore, you may be running your JUnit Jupiter tests in parallel, which makes using these resources flaky.

An example of this is a database, which may take such a long time to start up and shut down that it should be shared across as many tests as possible without being restarted, whilst also ensuring that no two tests are able to use it at the same time.

This extension solves these problems by allowing you to focus on the logic of creating and cleaning up a "resource", and having it injected into your tests. The extension takes care of cleaning up the resource when it's no longer needed, as well as ensuring that the tests using the resource run sequentially.

TODO: Give an example with a custom extension that reads from and writes to a PostgreSQL database with testcontainers: https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/databases/jdbc/
